# Coalgebraic Logic

Aahrrgg ... I was hoping to put my notes in bookform with `mdbook` but now it seems that it doesnt support TeX after all ... see 

```
Note: The usual delimiters MathJax uses are not yet supported. You can't currently use $$ ... $$ as delimiters and the \[ ... \] delimiters need an extra backslash to work. Hopefully this limitation will be lifted soon.

unfortunately, that is a deal breaker for me ...
